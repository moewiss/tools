## 🎬 **HOW TO USE WITH WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER**

### **Step 1: Download Video**

1. Go to **Subtitle Downloader**
2. Paste YouTube URL
3. Select language (English, Arabic, etc.)
4. Choose: **"Video + Separate Subtitle File"** ✅
5. Click **"Download"**

### **Step 2: What Happens**

The tool will:
1. ✅ Download the video
2. ✅ Check if YouTube has subtitles
   - If YES → Downloads existing subtitles
   - If NO → **AI generates subtitles automatically** 🤖
3. ✅ Creates a ZIP file with:
   - `video_name.mp4`
   - `video_name.srt` (matching name!)

### **Step 3: Extract ZIP File**

1. **Download the ZIP file**
2. **Right-click** → **Extract All**
3. Choose a folder (e.g., Desktop or Videos)
4. You'll see **2 files:**
   ```
   video_name.mp4
   video_name.srt
   ```

### **Step 4: Play in Windows Media Player**

**IMPORTANT:** The subtitle file MUST have the exact same name as the video!

✅ **Correct naming:**
```
my_video.mp4
my_video.srt  ← Same base name!
```

❌ **Wrong naming:**
```
my_video.mp4
subtitle.srt  ← Different name, won't work!
```

### **Step 5: Watch with Subtitles**

1. **Double-click the video file** (.mp4)
2. Windows Media Player opens
3. **Subtitles appear automatically!** ✅

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: "Subtitles don't appear"**

**Check these:**

1. ✅ **Files in same folder?**
   - Video and subtitle must be in the SAME folder

2. ✅ **Same filename?**
   - `video.mp4` and `video.srt` (exact match)

3. ✅ **File extension visible?**
   - In File Explorer: View → Show File Extensions
   - Make sure it's `.srt` not `.srt.txt`

4. ✅ **Subtitle file not empty?**
   - Right-click the .srt file → Properties
   - Size should be > 1 KB

### **Problem: "Downloaded ZIP but no subtitle file inside"**

**This means:**
- The video has NO speech/audio to transcribe
- OR AI couldn't detect clear speech

**Solution:**
- Try a different video with clear speech
- Check if the video has audio

### **Problem: "File names don't match"**

**Fix it:**
1. Right-click the subtitle file
2. Select **Rename**
3. Change it to match the video name exactly

**Example:**
- Video: `My Video.mp4`
- Subtitle should be: `My Video.srt`

## 🎯 **BEST PRACTICES**

### **1. File Naming**
✅ **DO:**
- Keep both files together
- Use simple names without special characters
- Example: `lesson_1.mp4` + `lesson_1.srt`

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use different names
- Separate files into different folders
- Use special characters: `!@#$%^&*()`

### **2. File Organization**
```
📁 My Videos/
   ├─ 📹 lesson_1.mp4
   ├─ 📄 lesson_1.srt
   ├─ 📹 lesson_2.mp4
   └─ 📄 lesson_2.srt
```

### **3. Testing**
Test with a short video first:
1. Download a 1-2 minute video
2. Check if both files are in the ZIP
3. Extract and test in Windows Media Player
4. If it works, proceed with longer videos
